You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.
## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
## Angular Best Practices
- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Do NOT set `standalone: true` inside the `@Component`, `@Directive` and `@Pipe` decorators
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
## Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- DO NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
## Templates
- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
## Services
- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
## State Management
- Use NgRx for state management
- Use `selectSignal()` over `select()`
- Always use facades between components and NgRx
- Facades will act as use cases, and their method names will reflect the business case they enable
- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead
## TDD
- When adding or modifying behaviour across facade + NgRx + services, start by writing a failing test against the facade
- When adding or modifying a component, start by writing a failing test against the component, creating a stub or fake for the facade
- Run the tests to ensure the new test is the only failing test
- Implement the absolute minimum code required to make the test pass
- Refactor the code to make it more readable, maintainable, and generic
- Run the tests again to ensure they all pass
- DO NOT USE MOCKS OR SPIES
